# Running the Bot Code
### Windows specific instructions
In order to run the code properly without errors, you must be running Python 3.11 or newer. I highly recommend checking "Add to PATH" during installation so you don't have to reference to the file location. Once you have Python installed, make sure that you're inside of the folder with the code by typing cmd at the top of the file explorer window. Once the command prompt is open, run python.exe -m venv env, then run .\env\Scripts\activate. This will put you into an environment where you can install packages locally. Next, run python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages for the bot.

Once you have your venv set up properly, you should be able to run python.exe main.py to run the bot! If your commands do not show up, try restarting Discord.

### Windows troubleshooting
If you receive python.exe not found or something similar, please rerun the installer, click modify, and click next, and make sure that Add python to environment variables is checked, then click Install.

### Linux specific instructions
In order to run the code properly without errors, you must be running Python 3.11 or newer. Once you have Python installed, run python3 -m venv env, then run source ./env/bin/activate. This will put you into an environment where you can install packages locally. Next, run python -m pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages for the bot.

Once you have your venv set up properly, you should be able to run python main.py to run the bot! If your commands do not show up, try restarting Discord
